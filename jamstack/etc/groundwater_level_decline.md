The **`Groundwater level decline`** shows how much lower the water level in the aquifers is, depending on the **"groundwater scenario"** selected. You have the option of choosing the "minimum threshold" that the GSP has selected in its Groundwater Sustainability Plan, or you may also choose how many feet below the 2019 groundwater level you want to see. For example, you can choose to see how many wells will go dry if the groundwater level is lowered by 10 feet, 20 feet, and more, up to 300 feet.  

To view alternate groundwater level decline scenarios, click the **"Select a groundwater scenario"** button on the left-hand sidebar, scroll to the desired scenario, and select it from the list.
