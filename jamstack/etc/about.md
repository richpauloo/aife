#### <i class="fas fa-angle-double-right fa-lg"></i> **Project Summary**  

About 1.5 million residents of Californiaâ€™s Central Valley rely on private domestic wells for drinking water ([Johnson and Belitz, 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969717317217)), and many of these wells can, and oftentimes do, fail during drought or as the result of unsustainable groundwater management. This project integrates and builds upon the body of existing literature and research to provide estimates of drinking water shortages for underserved populations. Local groundwater sustainability agencies (GSAs) and state regulators may use this information to inform and anticipate the impacts of groundwater sustainability plans (GSPs) on domestic well failure. Consulting firms may use this open model as a baseline for domestic well failure planning, and a jumping off point for more detailed spatial analyses and models.  

This project aims to integrate existing approaches ([Perrone and Jasechko, 2017](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa8ac0/meta); [Gailey et al., 2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10040-019-01929-w); [Pauloo, et al. 2020](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab6f10); Bostic, et al. 2020) into a unified, transparent, extensible well failure model. In order to facilitate decision-making and planning for sustainable groundwater management in California we present model estimates in an interactive decision-support tool.  

Importantly, the well failure and cost estimates provided herein (assuming groundwater levels reach specified minimum thresholds in critical priority basins) are consistent with results obtained in previous analyses by [EKI (2020)](https://waterfdn.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Groundwater-Management-and-Safe-Drinking-Water-in-the-San-Joaquin-Valley-Brief-6-2020.pdf), and Bostic et al. (2020).  The well failure model itself is based on the model described in [Pauloo, et al. (2020)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab6f10), which is consistent in terms of well failure estimates from the model described by [Gailey et al., 2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10040-019-01929-w).
