#### <i class="fas fa-angle-double-right fa-lg"></i> **Interpretation**  

The `Cost estimate` is the estimated cost of **pump lowering** and **well deepening** events for the selected `GSA`(s) and selected `Groundwater scenario`. There are both _lower_ and _upper_ cost estimates, commensurate with remediation actions taken as groundwater levels fall.  

* The _lower_ `Cost estimate` can be interpreted as the cost of **well deepening** events associated with the lower bound of `Well failure count` that arises when groundwater levels reach the total completed depth plus an operating margin of 3 meters.  
* The _upper_ `Cost estimate` can be interpreted as the combined cost of **pump lowering AND well deepening** events.

#### <i class="fas fa-angle-double-right fa-lg"></i> **Methods**  

A **pump lowering** occurs when the groundwater level falls below the pump location. Pumps are lowered to the total completed depth at a rate of $100/ft, consistent with the methodology of Gailey et al. (2019) and EKI (2020). Wells with lowered pumps can fail again when the groundwater level falls below the total completed depth plus an operating margin of 3 meters, whereupon a net positive suction head cannot be maintained (e.g., Tullis, 1989; Gailey, et al. 2019; Pauloo et al., 2020), and consequently, a **well deepening** is required.  

In this study, **well deepening** event increases the total completed depth of the well by 100 ft, at a cost of $115/ft, consistent with the methodology of Gailey et al. (2019) and EKI (2020).  

We neglect costs associated with increased lift, as these constitute around 1% of total costs (EKI, 2020). We also neglect costs associated with screen cleaning, as this action is unlikely to yield significant additional water when groundwater levels have fallen below pumps.
