This map shows the minimum threshold surface and the average 2019 groundwater level in feet below land surface (ft BLS). Red indicates a greater depth to groundwater.  

Toggle between the minimum threshold surface and 2019 groundwater level and hover on GSP areas to see their name. 

On the home page, click GSP areas to see a plot of how many wells are expected to fail as groundwater levels fall.

On GSP-specific pages, active (<i class="fas fa-circle" style="color:#6ba2e8"></i> blue marker) and failing (<i class="fas fa-circle" style="color:#ff6173"></i> red marker) well locations are shown. Click on markers to see well attributes.
