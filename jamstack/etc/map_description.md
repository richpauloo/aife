This map shows the minimum threshold surface and the average 2019 groundwater level in feet below land surface (ft BLS). Red indicates a greater depth to groundwater.  

Toggle between the minimum threshold surface and 2019 groundwater level and hover on GSAs to see their name. 

On the home page, click GSAs to see a plot of how many wells are expected to fail as groundwater levels fall.

On GSA-specific pages, active (blue marker) and failing (red marker) well locations are shown. Click on markers to see well attributes.
