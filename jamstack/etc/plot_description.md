This plot shows the percentage of failing wells (y axis) for a given groundwater level decline relative to the 2019 groundwater level (x axis).  

The red shaded region <i class="fas fa-square" style="color:#ffe0dd"></i> shows the user's selected groundwater level decline. If the minimum threshold scenario is selected, the closest groundwater level decline scenario(s) that correspond to a similar number of failing wells is shown.  

Hover on points to well failure statistics associated with various degrees of groundwater level decline.
