### **Purpose**

This tool was created to show you, the user, how groundwater management decisions will impact homes with domestic wells in the San Joaquin Valley. Groundwater Sustainability Agencies ("GSAs"), created following the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act of 2014, are in charge of how groundwater is used and managed. Polyc decisions made by GSAs will either protect domestic wells or allow them to go dry.  

<br>  

### **To use this tool, please follow these steps:**  

(1) Select the GSA that is most relevant to you. You may also select "All GSAs," which will show you results for all 25 of the GSAs included in this tool.

(2) Select between the options of groundwater levels and scenarios. You have the option of choosing the "minimum threshold"" that the GSA has specified in its Groundwater Sustainability Plan. You may also choose how many feet below the 2019 groundwater levels you want to see. For example, you can choose to see how many wells will go dry if the water in the aquifers is lowered by 10 feet, 20 feet, and more, up to 300 feet.

(3) Based on your selections, the tool will show you how many domestic wells are likely to go dry in that scenario for the GSA(s) you selected.  

If you do not know what Groundwater Sustainability Agency is relevant to you, search for your address using the Department of Water Resources' [GSA Map Viewer Tool](https://sgma.water.ca.gov/webgis/index.jsp?appid=gasmaster&rz=true).

### **Controls**  

Controls are labeled in the image and described below: 

<center>
  <img src="etc/inst_3.png" style="width: 80%">
</center>

1. `Groundwater level decline`, `Well failure count`, `Well failure percent`, and `Cost estimate` for the selected scenario. Click buttons to read more.  
2. Map controls:  
  - zoom in/out, full screen mode, zoom to home   
  - groundwater depth in feet below land surface (BLS)    
  - toggle data layers    
3. Hover for info. All forecasted well failures at various levels of groundwater level decline for the selected GSA are shown. The width of the bars shows the forecasted well failure range. The red shaded area shows the selected groundwater level decline.  

<br>

### **Additional features**  

On the [main page showing all GSAs](https://www.gsawellfailure.com), click on a GSA in the map to view the forecasted well failure plot for the selected GSA, and hover over the plot to view failure and cost statistics for each scenario.
