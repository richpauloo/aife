`dom_wells.rds`: domestic wells in critical-priority GSAs and within a 28 year retirement age* with selected data (wcr_num, lat, lon, pump_loc_low, pump_loc_up). Derived from [published data here (`domcv5ll_dry_GF.rds`)](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.25338/B8Q31D). `year` data was removed to reduce file size.
